# Ruby Test Portfolio
This is a small testing portfolio used for demoing Ruby test automation. It uses RSpec and Capybara to show both API automation and front-end automation.

## Instructions
If you are seeing this repo, I am likely providing a demo for you already. However, if you'd like to run these tests locally, you should be able do so after running `bundle install`.

## Credits
I've used the following tools for testing:

[Open Trivia DB API](https://opentdb.com/api_config.php) - An open API for generating trivia questions.
